# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

Iâ€™m an Infectious Disease and Antimicrobial Stewardship pharmacist diving into coding to streamline workflows and enhance antimicrobial stewardship.

Iâ€™m focusing on learning and integrating R and Python coding into my daily tasks, including research projects, data analysis, and improving patient care.

I am still very new to the coding space so open to feedback, collaboration, and ideas to optimize workflows and develop innovative solutions. 

Feel free to check out my public projects and reach out!
