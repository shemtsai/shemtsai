# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

Iâ€™m an Infectious Disease pharmacist diving into coding to streamline workflows and enhance antimicrobial stewardship.

Iâ€™m focusing on learning and integrating R and Python coding into my daily tasks, including research projects, data analysis, and improving patient care.

Open to feedback, collaboration, and ideas to optimize workflows and develop innovative solutions. Let's connect and share knowledge!

Feel free to check out my public projects and reach out!
