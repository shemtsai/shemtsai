# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

Iâ€™m an Infectious Disease and Antimicrobial Stewardship pharmacist diving into coding.

Iâ€™m focusing on learning and integrating R (and hopefully Python soon) into my daily tasks, including research projects, data analysis, and data visualization.

I am still very new to the coding space so open to feedback, collaboration, and ideas to optimize workflows and develop innovative solutions - appreciate your patience.

Feel free to check out my public projects and reach out!
